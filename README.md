# python-api-challenge
This is the repo to store the API challenge in Python
There are 2 Jupyter notebooks: VacationPy.ipynb and WeatherPy.ipynb

The Weather one visualizes the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator.
It will show a series of scatter plots as well as the linear regression for each relationship for the following:

- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

The Vacation one will aim to plan future vacations.
It will shows the cities matching a given requirement (temperature, wind, etc.) and provide a list of hotels nearby.
